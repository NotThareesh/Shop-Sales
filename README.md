# _Shop Sales_
_A simple program which can read items provided from a text file and read the accounts and balance from a .xlsx file.<br>
The __customers.xlsx__ file contains details about all the customers, their passwords and balances. The __items.txt__ 
file contains all the items which can be purchased by the user.<br><br>
The code automatically loads the data from both the files in one go.
Users don't need to manually add their account if they are not found in the __customers.xlsx__. They can add it from
the code itself._
