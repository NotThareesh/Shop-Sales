# Shop Sales
A simple program which can read items provided from a text file and read the accounts and balance from a .xlsx file.<br>
The **customers.xlsx** file contains details about all the customers, their passwords and balances. The **items.txt** 
file contains all the items which can be purchased by the user.

The code automatically loads the data from both the files in one go.
Users don't need to manually add their account credentials if they are not found in the **customers.xlsx**. 
They can add it from the code itself.

**Note: -** Install **openpyxl** before running the script. To do this, open Command Prompt/Terminal and paste the 
following code,`pip install openpyxl`.
